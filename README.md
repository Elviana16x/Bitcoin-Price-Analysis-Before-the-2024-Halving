## Project Description

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin price movements before the 2024 halving event. It follows a step-by-step approach, starting from data collection to predictive modeling, using Python programming language.

### Data Collection

Historical Bitcoin price data was gathered from a CSV file downloaded from an online source.

### Data Preprocessing

Missing values were handled, timestamps were converted to datetime format, and additional features such as daily returns and rolling averages were calculated.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visual analysis was conducted to observe price trends and fluctuations. Line plots were used to visualize Bitcoin price over time, while high and low prices were plotted to identify price ranges. Histograms were utilized to analyze the distribution of daily returns.

### Model Selection

Linear Regression was selected as the machine learning model due to its suitability for continuous variable prediction.

### Model Training

The data was split into training and testing sets (80/20), and the Linear Regression model was trained on the training data.

### Model Evaluation

Model performance was assessed using mean squared error on the testing data.

### Predictive Analysis

The trained model was utilized to forecast Bitcoin prices post-halving.

### Fine-Tuning

Parameter adjustment and algorithm optimization were explored to enhance model accuracy.

### Monitoring and Updating

Continuous model monitoring and updating with new data were emphasized to maintain relevance and accuracy over time.
